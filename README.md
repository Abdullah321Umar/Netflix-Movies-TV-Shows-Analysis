# 📊 Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 🧠 Project Overview
I developed a fully interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize trends in Netflix’s global content library. The dashboard provides insights into content distribution, genre popularity, release patterns, ratings, and country-wise contributions. This project helps stakeholders and content strategists understand audience preferences, track content expansion, and make data-informed decisions for content planning and user engagement.
